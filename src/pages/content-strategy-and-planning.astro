					To understand customer sentiment towards Hotjar Help Center content, I put in place a Helpfulness Index for each article by
					fetching article vote counts using the Zendesk API. Crossing this with Google Analytics data, I set up a priority score that
					dynamically updates to ensure we select the most critical content to improve in our weekly update cycles.

					I've also completed audits of the Help Center to optimize content, make it more maintainable, and ensure it aligns with customer
					needs. By setting up a weekly maintenance rotation, I created a system of improving documentation from two directions:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>More frequently used docs are naturally updated more regularly.</li>
					<li>
						Lesser visited docs aren't left to the side and will remain optimized for search engines while also building customer trust in
						our documentation and, therefore, the product.
					</li>
				</ul>
