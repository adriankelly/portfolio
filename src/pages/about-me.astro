				<p>
					I'm a Customer Education Manager with a background that crosses multiple continents and disciplines. Born in New Zealand and
					growing up in Australia, I graduated from university with law and political science degrees before diving into marketing research
					analysis and later working as a web developer in London. I draw on these experiences as a Customer Education Manager, helping me
					reduce complex concepts into clear content that empowers users to find value quickly. I also leverage my analytical skills to
					inform content strategy and improve content performance.
				</p><br />
				<p>
					I'm a music and coffee lover and also an avid runner, finding peace and inspiration in the trails of Haute-Savoie, France, where I
					live with my wife and two daughters.
